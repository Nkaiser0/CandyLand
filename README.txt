# CandyLand

This game is awesome and that's why it should get 100.

Joking aside, this game deserves a 100 because we tried to implement some of the hardest elements of HTML, CSS, and JS that we learned.
Although it looks crude to the naked eye, our goal was to create a structurally sound game that can entertain users of all ages and reflexes.
We tried our best to create a theme that matched the title of our game "CandyLand."
In addition, we also added extra functions that were not required in the rubric. For example, we added a start/stop button to let users pause the game.
We also modified the CSS file included with the High Score API to match that element to the theme we created for "CandyLand."
The pictures used were all cropped by hand using Adobe Photoshop even though we could've left a little bit of white space around the edges.
We also had to create our own algorithm to control the rate of falling candy. Instead of having a linear rate, we decided to use a time variable to create a fall rate that increases with time.
Overall, we implemented elements that were not required of us in order to make a stable, functioning JavaScript game.
Although the graphics could be improved, the actual code is intuitive and goes beyond what was requried for the project.

CSS:
	+Literally eye candy
	+3D effect for headers
	+Color gradient for both canvas and background
	+Table
	+Wait for it, DARK MODE
Java Script:
	+Set interval to mock a timer
	+Images falling one by one using interval and logic
	+Game resets itself when begin is clicked
	+Game can be stopped anytime
	+It gets harder through time
	+Cool effect when game is over

There were some features that were hard to implement at first. Getting the candy to fall took a few tries modifying the JS code.\
In addition, the scaling fall speed was very hard to get right. Through trial and error we eventually settled on the right rate to use.
Implmenting dark mode was a pain since we had to modify the existing CSS code to use variables.
Coding with three different people created styling problems that took time to resolve when we ran the different validating services.
